        <p>Valentinos was first established in the Worcestershire village of Upton-upon-Severn in 1988, by Franco, and his wife, Mandy. Following the success of Valentinos, it was relocated to a larger restaurant in Worcester in 1997.
          Over twenty years later, and with the help of his brother, Gino, and a long standing, committed group of staff, Valentinos continues to have an exceptional reputation for the quality of our food, and the friendly service we provide
          In committing to maintain such high standards, we endeavour to use only the finest ingredients, delivered with a homemade touch.
